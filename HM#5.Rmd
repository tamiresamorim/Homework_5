### Improving Regression Models to explain wages

The goal on this project is to understand the variables chosen and how they affect the results. We will do that by experimenting regression models with different inputs to see if our assumptions contain important information for the explanation of wage.  

First we loaded the data and subset it for the group chosen. The group contain Asians in the workforce, ages between 25 and 55, working full time hours at least 48 weeks of the year.
```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
load("~/R/acs2017_ny_data.RData")
attach(acs2017_ny)
use_varb <- (AGE >= 25) & (AGE <= 55) & (LABFORCE == 2) & (WKSWORK2 > 4) & (UHRSWORK >= 35)&(Asian=1)
dat_use <- subset(acs2017_ny,use_varb) # 
detach()
```
